     *              which would otherwise cause infinite recursion when converting to JSON
     *              (a Student object contains StudentDetails, which contains Student which contains StudentDetails...)

     * Using both annotations together is the recommended practice for bidirectional relationships
     * to prevent recursion issues in different contexts (string representation and JSON serialization).
